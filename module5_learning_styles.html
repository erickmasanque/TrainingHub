Do you find a video on YouTube so you can see every step? Do you prefer a written recipe you can follow precisely? Or are you the type who just gets your hands dirty in the kitchen and learns by doing? There's no wrong answer! This choice reveals your natural preference for learning. Today, we'll explore these preferences, from how we use our senses to how our brains process information, and finally, we'll look at the different ways we can be 'smart.'"

                notes: "By the end of our report, our goal is for everyone here to walk away with four key things. We'll be able to describe the main learning styles from the module, and maybe even identify our own. We'll also get a clear understanding of Multiple Intelligences, and most importantly, we'll learn how to plan activities that cater to all these differences, making us more effective future educators."

                notes: "So what exactly are we talking about? The module gives us this very clear definition. A learning style is simply a person's preferred way of processing information. This is a crucial point. It’s not about being smart or not smart. It’s about the natural path your brain takes when trying to understand something new. Think of it like being right-handed or left-handed. One isn't better than the other; they are just different preferences for how you interact with the world."

                notes: "The first way we can categorize these styles is by looking at our senses. Which sense do you rely on most when learning? Visual learners need to see the teacher's facial expressions, they love charts and graphs. Auditory learners tune into the lecture, the discussion, the tone of voice. And kinesthetic learners are the students who need to be hands-on—they learn by building the model, performing the experiment, or role-playing the scenario."

"Learns best from what they can read."</p></div></div>`,
                notes: "Now, the module makes an interesting point: not all visual learners are the same. A 'Visual-Iconic' learner wants the actual picture—the photograph, the diagram, the video. But a 'Visual-Symbolic' learner is also visual, but they prefer symbols—they want to see the words, the numbers, the formulas. So, one student might want a diagram of the solar system, while another would prefer to read a list of the planets and their characteristics. Both are visual, but they need different kinds of visual input."
            },
            // Slide 7: A Closer Look at Auditory Learners
            {

They learn by asking questions and talking things through. They may find it hard not to talk in class.</p></div></div>`,
                notes: "Similarly, auditory learners aren't all the same. The module points out two types. First, you have the 'Listeners.' These are the students who can absorb a lecture effortlessly. They remember what was said, not just what was on the board. Then you have the 'Talkers.' They also learn through sound, but it has to be interactive. They learn by verbalizing, by asking questions, by discussing with a seatmate. They are the ones who find it difficult when the teacher says, 'Okay, no more questions, just listen.'"

                notes: "Okay, so we've talked about how we take in information. Now let's talk about what our brain does with it. This is the Global-Analytic continuum, often linked to left-brain and right-brain dominance. Analytic, or left-brain thinkers, are 'tree seers.' They need to see each detail, one by one, in a logical order to build their understanding. Global, or right-brain thinkers, are 'forest seers.' They need to see the whole forest—the main idea, the final outcome—before they can make sense of the individual trees."

                notes: "This table from our module is fantastic because it shows us how these preferences play out in real life. Take a look at a few pairs. Analytic thinkers respond to the literal meaning of words, while global thinkers respond more to the tone of voice. Analytic thinkers recall names; global thinkers recall faces. As you look at this list, you might start to see yourself more on one side than the other. This self-awareness is the first step to becoming a better learner and a better teacher."

This theory by Howard Gardner was revolutionary because it blew up the idea that you were either 'smart' or 'not smart' based on a single IQ score. Gardner argued that intelligence is much broader. It’s the ability to solve a problem or create something that is valued in a culture. This means a skilled carpenter in the province is just as intelligent as a lawyer in Makati—they just have different kinds of intelligence."

We must become a 'guide on the side.' We must become facilitators who understand that the 40 students in front of us have 40 different combinations of styles and intelligences. Our challenge—and our opportunity—is to create a classroom where everyone has a chance to learn in the way that works best for them."

Number 3 is about slowing down and fighting the urge to just 'cover the content.' And Number 4 is about setting expectations, so students know what to look for."

The writers in his class can write a story. The artists can draw a diagram. The active, kinesthetic learners can create a dance. And the musically inclined students can write a song. In one lesson, he has engaged at least four different intelligences and given students the power to choose how they want to show their learning."
